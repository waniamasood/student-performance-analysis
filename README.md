üéì Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes a Student Performance dataset to explore how different factors (gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, and test preparation) impact academic scores in math, reading, and writing.  
The analysis is visualized using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
